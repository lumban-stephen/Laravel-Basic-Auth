SINS avoided:

Entries are not placed or hard coded into the database, instead it uses the Fortify tool of Laravel to handle queries.

My registration has input validation. The system blocks everything except the necessary inputs.

The database used does not expose the password when seen through the database. The passwords are encrypted for safety against hackers.
